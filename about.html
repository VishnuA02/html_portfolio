<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an Electronics and Communication Engineering student at SSN College of Engineering, expected to graduate in 2026. With a strong foundation in both hardware and software, I am passionate about software development, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>

<p>Throughout my academic journey, I have gained hands-on experience in programming languages such as Python, C, C++, and SQL. I have completed multiple projects including a smart emergency vehicle management system using Arduino, a machine learning model to predict calories burned using XGBoost, and an ensemble-based churn prediction model using Python and data science tools.</p>

<p>I am always eager to learn new technologies and apply them to solve real-world problems. My internship at SAVIC Technologies further strengthened my skills in backend development using Django and AI-based tool creation. Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities where I can grow as a developer and contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.</p>
